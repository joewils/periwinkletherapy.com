<p>Friends and colleagues Christy Adams, Occupational Therapist, and Michelle Coppess, Speech-Language Pathologist, began working together in 2003 at the local birth to three program.  Both therapists quickly learned to love the nature of family-centered practice.  They soon realized that there was a definite need for private therapy services for many of the North Idaho children that were exiting out of their care at the age of three.  In 2008, based on their shared commitment to helping children of all ages and their families, the pair formed Periwinkle Children’s Therapy. </p>

<p>They set up in a small office space, started scouring garage sales for the most exciting and educational toys and games, and began scheduling kids to come along with them on this new adventure.  Along the way there have been plenty of bumps in the road, from fighting with snow plows who bury their parking lot to battling with insurance companies on behalf of their clients.  But what they’ve found is the joy of getting to work with the kids they love and being able to meet their needs the best way they know how.  </p>

<p>In 2012, Periwinkle moved to a new, 1500-square-foot office space and expanded their team to include a physical therapist and additional speech-language pathologists.</p>
