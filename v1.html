					  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
					
            <h3>What does children’s therapy&#160;involve?</h1>
            <p>Therapy with young children centers around what children do best: play.  Professional therapists work through natural play routines to target areas of concern in your child’s development. </p>
            <br style="clear:all;"/>

            <h3>How do I know if my child would benefit from&#160;therapy?</h1>
            <p>The best way to determine if your child needs therapy is to take a look at his peers.  Do your child’s abilities seem different from those of friends her age?  Do you sense that she might be “falling behind” compared to other children?  Talk to your child’s teachers, physician, and others in his environment to determine if your concerns need to be addressed.</p>
            <br style="clear:all;"/>

            <h3>What should I do if I think my child might need&#160;help?</h1>
            <p>If you are concerned about your child’s development, call Periwinkle Children’s Therapy for a phone consultation with one of our therapists.  An appointment for an evaluation can be made at a time that is convenient for you.  Using the results of the individualized evaluation, you and your child’s therapist will determine whether therapy is appropriate for your child.</p>
            <br style="clear:all;"/>

            <h3>What is Occupational&#160;Therapy?</h1>
            <p>Occupational therapists use their unique expertise to help children with social-emotional, physical, cognitive, communication, and adaptive behavior challenges.  They work to discover and maximize each child’s potential for participation in family, learning, and community-based activities.  </p>

            	<p>Occupational therapy focuses on enabling children to do the activities of daily life.  Because a child’s primary activity is play, the occupational therapist uses creative and productive activities to work on:</p>
            	<ul>
            		<li>Fine motor control</li>
            		<li>Self-help skills</li>
            		<li>Pre-academic skills</li>
            		<li>Social skills</li>
            		<li>Sensory integration</li>
            		<li>Handwriting</li>
            		<li>Visual/perceptual skills</li>
            	</ul>
              <br style="clear:all;"/>

            <h3>What is Speech/Language&#160;Therapy?</h1>
              <p>Speech-language pathologists specialize in working with children on the basics of communication: speech, language, and oral-motor skills.</p>
              <p>Speech describes the way a child uses sounds to say his words.  Problems with speech might include: </p>
            	<ul>
            		<li>Difficulty saying certain sounds</li>
            		<li>Leaving sounds out of words</li>
            		<li>Substituting sounds in words</li>
            		<li>Poor intelligibility</li>
            		<li>Frustration</li>
            	</ul> 
            	<p>Language describes the components of communication that children are expected to have mastered for their age level.  Common issues related to language are: </p>
              <ul>
            		<li>Limited vocabulary</li>
            		<li>Poor comprehension of spoken or written language</li>
            		<li>Social skills problems</li>
            		<li>Behavior issues</li>
            	</ul>
            	<p>Oral-motor skills involve the abilities of the muscles used for speech and swallowing.</p>
              <br style="clear:all;"/>

            <h3>How does therapy at Periwinkle&#160;work?</h1>
            <p>Therapy consists of one-on-one sessions with a certified therapist skilled in working with young children.  Parents are encouraged to participate in therapy sessions and learn techniques that can be used at home.  Children attend therapy once or twice a week for 30-60 minutes, depending on age.</p>
            <br style="clear:all;"/>

            <h3>What type of payment does Periwinkle&#160;accept?</h1>
