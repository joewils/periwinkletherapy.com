<h2>What does children's therapy involve?</h2>
<p>Therapy with children centers around what kids do best: play.  Professional therapists work through natural play routines to target areas of concern in your child's development. </p>

<h2>How do I know if my child would benefit from therapy?</h2>
<p>The best way to determine if your child needs therapy is to take a look at his peers.  Do your child's abilities seem different from those of friends her age?  Do you sense that she might be "falling behind" compared to other children?  Talk to your child's teachers, physician, and others in his environment to determine if your concerns need to be addressed. </p>

<h2>How does therapy at Periwinkle work?</h2>
<p>Therapy consists of one-on-one sessions with a certified therapist skilled in working with young children.  Parents are encouraged to participate in therapy sessions and learn techniques that can be used at home.  Children attend therapy once or twice a week for 30-60 minutes, depending on age.  </p>

<h2>What should I do if I think my child might need help?</h2>
