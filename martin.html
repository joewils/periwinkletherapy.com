<p>Hunter and Tanner Martin have been growing through Periwinkle. They have been clients since Periwinkle opened their doors. Both boys are severely autistic and have speech delays. Hunter is non verbal and we were told he'd never be able to communicate, or learn to use any computerized device to communicate. But the ladies at Periwinkle saw potential and now Hunter can speak using an iPad with the Proloqo2go program. Our family feels valued and understood by these wonderful therapists, and we recommend them every chance we get. </p>
