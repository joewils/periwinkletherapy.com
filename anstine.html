<p>I brought my son, Marcus, to Periwinkle for speech therapy with Michelle when he was about 2 years old.  Marcus was non-verbal and had an Autism diagnosis.  Michelle connected with Marcus immediately!  Her warm personality combined with her skills and techniques stretched his abilities while he had 'fun.'  Her coaching and guidance led us through sign language into verbal communication in a relatively short period of time.  Michelle is a trusted adviser, an advocate for kids, and an absolute specialist in her field.  I can never thank her enough for all she has done for Marcus and our family!</p>
