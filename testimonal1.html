<p>Brianna has received Speech Therapy and Occupational Therapy from Periwinkle Children's Therapy since she was 3 years old.  Under the care of Periwinkles' wonderful therapists, she has grown and progressed by leaps.  Periwinkle has a very warm feel and every therapist we have interacted with has been incredibly knowledgeable and caring.  Scheduling is very convenient and they work hard to fit the schedule to families needs and wants.  In the years we have been working with Periwinkle, I can say I have come to feel a genuine friendship with staff and have no doubts that Brianna's progress is nearly as important to her therapists as it is to us.  I would and do recommend Periwinkle to anyone.</p>
