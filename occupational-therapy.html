<h2>What is Occupational Therapy?</h2>
<p>Occupational therapists use their unique expertise to help children with social-emotional,
physical, cognitive, communication, and adaptive behavior challenges.  They work to discover and maximize each child's potential for participation in family, learning, and community-based activities.  </p>

<p>Occupational therapy focuses on enabling children to do the activities of daily life.  Because a child's primary activity is play, the occupational therapist uses creative and productive
activities to work on:</p>

	<li>Social skills</li>
	<li>Sensory integration</li>

	<li>Visual/perceptual skills</li>
